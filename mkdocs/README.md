## To deploy MkDocs with Docker Compose, follow these steps:

## Create a New Directory:
Create a new directory on your host system for your MkDocs container. You can name it ## mkdocs or any other name of your choice.

## Docker Compose File:

Inside this new directory, create a docker-compose.yml file.

Create Documentation Directory:

Within the mkdocs directory, create another directory called docs. This will hold all your documentation files.
